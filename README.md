No need to worry about me having access to your password, as all user passwords are encrypted using Bcyrpt!

Once the user log's in, they will be redirected to their `dashboard` where they would find their created posts.

Inside the `dashboard` the log in user can create new posts, edit existing posts, or just delete the post entirely.
